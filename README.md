The latest version will be in branches.
As part of my project portfolio, I developed a real-time monitoring and control interface using Flaskâ€”a lightweight web framework in Python. This application provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling vacuum pump systems in industrial settings. Leveraging Flask's flexibility and simplicity, I designed a responsive web UI that communicates with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) to fetch real-time data and control parameters of multiple vacuum pumps.
Thanks for checking it out!
